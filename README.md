# claude-ab-ag-llm

This repository currently serves as a placeholder while the project scope and technology stack are defined. There is no source code yet, so the immediate focus is on establishing a clear direction and a minimal scaffold for future development.

## Getting Started
1. Decide on the primary language and framework for the application.
2. Create an initial project layout (for example, `src/` and `tests/`) along with basic tooling (dependency manifest, formatter, and linter).
3. Document setup and usage instructions as the implementation takes shape.

## Contributing
Once the project structure is in place, add contribution guidelines and a code of conduct to clarify expectations for collaborators.
